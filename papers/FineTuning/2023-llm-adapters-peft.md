# Title: LLM-Adapters: An Adapter Family for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning

## 📝 Summary
The paper explores the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. It proposes LLM-Adapters, a modular framework supporting various adapter configurations like Series, Parallel, and LoRA. The authors assess these across reasoning tasks and LLM sizes to identify optimal strategies.

## 💡 Key Contributions
- Introduced LLM-Adapters: a unified framework to test multiple adapter configurations with LLMs.
- Provided empirical comparison across 14 datasets and multiple open-source models.

## 🔬 Methodology
The study benchmarks adapter configurations (Series, Parallel, LoRA) on reasoning tasks (math, commonsense) using LLaMA, GPT-J, and BLOOM. Placement strategies (post-attention vs post-MLP) and hyperparameters are varied to assess performance.

## 📊 Results
- Series and Parallel adapters performed best when placed after MLP layers.
- LoRA was most effective when used post-attention and post-MLP.
- PEFT-equipped LLaMA-13B outperformed ChatGPT on simpler datasets.

## ❗ Limitations / Assumptions
- No comparison of computational cost or training efficiency between methods.
- Limited to models up to 13B parameters.

## 🌍 Impact on Real World
This study helps democratize LLM usage by reducing the need for full fine-tuning, enabling small organizations to adapt LLMs with minimal resources. It provides a practical guide for applying PEFT in production settings.
